To run an analysis, you need the following inputs: Input FASTQ data Reference fasta Used sequencing primers in correct format Sequencing platform Amplicon-type Preparing your input primers \u00b6 In order to get optimal results, please make sure the fasta headers in your fasta file with primers are formatted properly. Please make sure the fasta headers are formatted according the following format: >{primer-name}_{primer-number}_{orientation} It's important that the primers which together form a single amplicon have the same primer-name and number. Orientation keywords for forward primers are: \"LEFT\" / \"PLUS\" / \"POSITIVE\" / \"FORWARD\" Orientation keywords for reverse primers are: \"RIGHT\" / \"MINUS\" / \"NEGATIVE\" / \"REVERSE\" Example of formatted primer names from the ArticV3 SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocol >nCoV-2019_1_LEFT ACCAACCAACTTTCGATCTCTTGT >nCoV-2019_1_RIGHT CATCTTTAAGATGTTGACGTGCCTC >nCoV-2019_2_LEFT CTGTTTTACAGGTTCGCGACGT >nCoV-2019_2_RIGHT TAAGGATCAGTGCCAAGCTCGT If your protocol has alternative primers then make sure the fasta header contains the \"alt\" keyword in the following format: >{primer-name}_{primer-number}_alt_{orientation} Please make sure the \"alt\" keyword is in the middle and not at the end of the fasta header.

This information is important because given primers will be removed from the reads during the analysis. In the ViroConstrictor pipeline the primer-removal is done by our tool AmpliGone . The information regarding the \"amplicon type\" is required because it tells te pipeline, and therefore also AmpliGone, from which side(s) of a read the primer-sequence has to be removed. Currently there are two options: \"End-to-End\" or \"End-to-Mid\". In short: \"End-to-End\" means that the sequenced read covers the full length of an amplicon. Meaning that the primer-sequence is present at both ends of a read. \"End-to-Mid\" means that the sequences read only partially covers the length of the amplicon. Meaning that the primer-sequence is present at only one end of a read. Also see the AmpliGone documentation regarding amplicon-types where we go into more detail regarding these types and what these terms mean. Please check your sequencing and laboratory setup for the amplicon type to match your analysis to ensure the best results. Running an analysis \u00b6 Please also see the command-line help document for a quick explanation of every possible argument: viroconstrictor -h You can start an analysis with a command such as the following: viroconstrictor \\ --input { path/to/FastQ-files } \\ --output { path/to/desired/output/folder } \\ --primers { path/to/primers.fasta / NONE } \\ --platform { nanopore/illumina/iontorrent } \\ --amplicon-type { end-to-end/end-to-mid } \\ --threads { threads } Here, threads refers to the amount of threads that ViroConstrictor may use on your LOCAL machine. If you're using ViroConstrictor on a HPC/cluster then these threads will only be used during the pre-processing steps. If you're using ViroConstrictor on your local machine then the given amount of threads will act as a 'ceiling' of usable threads during analysis. If your sequencing protocol does not use primers then set \"NONE\" for the primers flag with --primers NONE .
